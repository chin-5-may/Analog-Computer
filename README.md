# Analog-Computer
Analog Computer is a simulation of a mass-spring-damper system using op-amp-based analog circuits. It models second-order dynamics with summers, integrators, and a Deboo integrator, and analyzes the system under free fall, damping, and oscillation conditions through theoretical, simulated, and experimental validation.
